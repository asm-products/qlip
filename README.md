# [Qlip](https://assembly.com/qlip)

This is a **Work in Progress** and **not** ready for use.

Qlip helps you move data like magic. If you want to copy a text from your phone to your PC.
Or even a song from your phone to your iPod. You just copy from one device then paste it on another.

Qlip also helps you move little pieces of data between you and your friends. When you copy something 
it generously asks you whether if to paste it onto your friends' devices.

Qlip is so tiny it wont even bother you. Some people use it everyday but have forgotten that it's there.
Because it runs in the background.

## Roadmap
- [x] Register the project in Assembly.
- [ ] Create an MVP for Qlip **Website**. (Sign-up, Settings, Downloads, Pricing)

- [ ] Create an MVP for Qlip **android agent**. Communicates with station.   
- [ ] Add support for transferring regular **files** using Qlip. I think it should have size limit.   
- [ ] Add basic **social** functions. Ask whom to send, right after something is being copied. It's interface should NOT bother the user.
